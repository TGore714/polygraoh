How Polygraph Exams Work: A Clear Guide for Oklahoma City Clients
At Verity Polygraph Services in Oklahoma City, we understand that most people have seen polygraph testing only in TV shows or movies. But real-life lie detector tests are far more structured, science-based, and reliable than Hollywood makes them seem.
If you’ve ever searched online for “how does a polygraph test work” or “lie detector test near me”, this guide explains the process in clear, simple terms—while showing you how we provide professional polygraph services to the Oklahoma City metro area.

What Is a Polygraph Exam?
A polygraph, often called a lie detector, is a scientific tool that records physiological changes in your body as you answer a series of carefully crafted questions. These changes—such as heart rate, breathing, blood pressure, and skin conductivity—are involuntary, making them useful indicators for truth verification.
Common reasons people search for polygraph testing in Oklahoma City include:
•	Relationship and infidelity concerns
•	Criminal or legal investigations
•	Employment screening for law enforcement or security jobs
•	Clearing one’s name from false accusations

How Does a Lie Detector Test Work?
Our Oklahoma City polygraph exams use advanced sensors to measure three primary responses:
1.	Cardiovascular Activity – Heart rate and blood pressure changes.
2.	Respiratory Patterns – Breathing changes detected via chest and abdominal movement.
3.	Electrodermal Activity – Subtle changes in skin conductivity caused by sweat gland activity.
These readings are displayed on a computer and analyzed by a licensed Oklahoma polygraph examiner to determine whether the responses are consistent with truthful or deceptive answers.

The Step-by-Step Polygraph Process
At Verity Polygraph Services, our exams follow three key phases:
1. Pre-Test Interview
We explain the process, review the questions, and make sure you understand everything. This also helps establish your baseline readings.
2. Data Collection
You’re connected to the polygraph sensors, and we ask the prepared questions in a controlled sequence.
We use a mix of:
•	Investigative/Suitability Questions – Directly tied to the matter under investigation.
•	Profile/Diagnostic Questions – Designed to establish physiological contrast.
•	Known Truth/Diagnostic Questions – Simple, non-threatening queries to maintain baseline data.
3. Post-Test Review
The examiner reviews your charts and may discuss preliminary findings with you. A formal polygraph report can be provided if requested.
