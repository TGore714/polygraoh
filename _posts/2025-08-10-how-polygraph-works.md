A polygraph, often called a "lie detector," is a device used to help determine if someone is telling the truth. It doesn’t actually detect lies directly, but instead measures how your body reacts when you answer questions.

Here’s what happens during a polygraph test:

Measuring Physical Responses: The polygraph machine records several bodily signals at the same time, including your heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure, and sweat levels. These signals can change when you feel nervous, stressed, or anxious — emotions that often come up when someone isn’t being truthful.

Asking Questions: The examiner asks a series of questions, some relevant to the investigation and others neutral or control questions. The idea is to compare your body’s reactions to different types of questions.

Analyzing Reactions: If your physical responses are stronger or more unusual when answering certain questions, the examiner might conclude you’re feeling stress or anxiety related to those questions. That could suggest you’re not being truthful, but it’s not a guarantee.

Important Note: A polygraph is not 100% accurate. Factors like nervousness, fear, or medical conditions can affect the results. That’s why polygraph results are usually used alongside other evidence and information, rather than being the sole proof.

In summary, a polygraph works by monitoring how your body physically reacts when you answer questions, helping trained examiners assess if those reactions suggest truthfulness or deception.
